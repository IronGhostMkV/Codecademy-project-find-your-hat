# Codecademy-project-find-your-hat
Codecademy project game: "find your hat" Objective: Create a game to be played in the console where you have a randomized field with a randomized location of your hat that you lost and have to now find without going out of bounds or falling in a hole.  Note: The code uploaded here is not my own. Instead, it is Codecademy's source code/solution but to help myself learn and understand it I've analyzed the code and made my own notes. The intent was not to just complete the project and check it off of a "to do" list but rather to gain a deeper understanding of the code/solution. This is my first programming course with Codecademy and I'm still learning how to think like a programmer and understand the tools at my disposal.
